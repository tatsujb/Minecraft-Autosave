# Minecraft-Autosave (for linux & mac but also works on windows poweshell or git shell or ubuntu shell, thanks to win10, anniversary edition)
Autosaves your minecraft save files and synchronizes across your computers


meant for debian based distributions. (tested in ubuntu 17.04) should work in any linux distro with git installed.

(do not run on several computers at once AKA : remember to stop the script when switching computers)

To use download Minecraft-Autosave.sh, place anywhere, make executable, if your distro permits it and is already configured to run shell scripts you may double click it if not right click an empty area of the folder it is in (grid view rather than list view to have acess to empty are) and select "Open in terminal", type "./Minecraft-Autosave.sh", or if you're not in the folder it is in "path/to/Minecraft-Autosave.sh".
to stop the script type CTRL-C (like copy).
